# [Employee-Tracker](https://github.com/ariehh1/Employee-Tracker)

In this repository, I have created a command line application that allows users to track their company's employees. Using node, inquirer, and MySQL, the user is guided through a set of prompts to uncover their employees, roles, and departments. This interface is an example of a Content Management System which make it easier for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases.

The following prompts are listed in the command line application: "View all employees, View all departments, View job titles, Add an employee, Add a department, Add a role, and Update employee role". To exit the application, simply select "Exit" and your previous entries will be saved.

<h1>User Story:</h1>
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business

<h1>Setup:</h1>
1) Clone the repository on your local device and open Terminal or Bash
2) In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to download all application dependencies: "npm install"
3) In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to run the application: "node index.js"
4) Once the command is run, a successful message will appear "Welcome to the Employee Tracker application!"

<h1>Technologies Utilized:</h1>
JavaScript, MySQL, MySQL npm, InquirerJs npm, console.table, CFonts

<h1>Future Development:</h1>
If I were to continue building out this application, I would have added in more user prompts. Examples such as deleting an employee or role from the database and viewing the top salaries by department could have been developed further. To eliminate any duplication efforts, a prompt message could have appeared that evaluated previous user input.
